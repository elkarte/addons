## Introduction:
Using this addon will give URLs posted in your topics an descriptive title.  If a user posts a link outside of bbcode tags and optionally within them, this addon will find them, look up the webpage, get the title, and replace the link with a BBC url with the webpages title.

```https://www.somesite.com will convert to [url=https://www.somesite.com]Website Title[/url] and display as Website Title```

## Features:
 -  Adds capability to automatically update links in posts to display the links website/page title instead of the url.
 -  Converts internal links to show the topic subject or board name as appropriate, external links to website title
 -  Optional length and generic name protection to avoid changing links to things like Login, Welcome, etc
 -  Optionally convert links contained inside of BBC URL codes
 -  Permissions to allow users to disable link conversion on a per post basis (under post additional options)
 -  Only converts links when the post is saved or modified, ensuring no performance impact during normal message viewing.

## Installation:
This addon make 2 template edits in order to add a checkbox to the post template advanced option section.  This option allows a user to disable the function for a particular post as some links are better left as URL's.
