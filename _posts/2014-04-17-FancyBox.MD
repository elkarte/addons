## Introduction:
This adds a lightbox / zoom effect to thumbnail images and attachments in your post.  It will work on attachments and in-line images.

## Features:
-  Expands a thumbnail (attachment or in-line image) in to a full-size image in a picture frame when clicked
-  Auto size images to fit browser window, with option to expand to full size
-  Slideshow for images on page, grouping by individual message images (attchment and inline) in the topic
-  Prev / Next navigation with arrow keys
-  Various admin center settings to control how it looks, just a couple.
-  Option to disable it on linked bbc images as you normally get from a photo share site
-  Ability to work with a limited number of photo share sites, so this will allow you to post the image thumb and when clicked display the full image.  Should work with imageshack,  photobucket, radikal, fotosik, postimage, flickr, and smugmug
