### Intro
Levertine Gallery 1.2.2. This is an adaption of the Levertine Gallery to the ElkArte Platform.

### Features
- Supports uploading huge files out of the box - no matter what your server configuration is.
- Uploading in bulk is available straight away. It is built using HTML5, so it works even on mobile devices, for example to upload photos straight off your phone direct to the forum! Phones, tablets, desktops, all the features are available on all platforms!
- Supports image, video, audio, document, archive and other formats.  All selectable by the admin
- Supports metadata/exif for most image, audio and video formats.
- Robust quota system, customizable by member/group/media type and more.
- Albums can be made for members, for groups or for the site as a whole. Whatever your community needs, LevGal has you covered. Albums can also be owned by multiple members (or groups) - good for collaboration between members for example.
- Members can rearrange their albums with a handy drag and drop interface! Even if two members both jointly own an album, their preferences for album arrangement are kept for them.
- LevGal comes with its own bbcode's, [media] and [clear] to handle putting images in posts, quickly and easily. Common links to items (including the bbcode) are shown on every item page, complete with a little "copy to clipboard" button to easily copy the link code for you. There are also integrated social sharing options built right in too!

### Fundamentals
Of course, all the fundamental things you might expect as well, including:

- __Comments__ with moderation / approval options
- __Notifications__ for liked items, new items to albums and new comments
- __Unseen__ items
- __Likes__ for items
- __Bookmarking__ your favorite items with easy access via your profile
- __Tagging__ with a tag cloud view
- __Searching__ with many parameters options to help find what you want fast!

All come as standard and are ready to go as soon as you install and start uploading items!
