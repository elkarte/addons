## Introduction:
A system where members can be given awards to display in their profile and posts.

## Features:
-  Awards can be placed in categories for display grouping and easy maintenance
-  Awards can be defined as assignable so members with assign awards permission can give an award (not define a new award though)
-  Awards can be defined as requestable so members can request and award for the moderation team to approve / deny
-  Awards can be assigned by member, by group or by mass selection
-  Automatic award assignment can be set for various milestones such as post count, topic count, join date, time on line, etc
-  Award post placement can be defined on a per award basis, above avatar, below avatar or with signature.  Allows you to define badges as well as awards
-  The award image and the details assigned with the image are stored and can then be assigned to members.
-  Once assigned, the member can view his/her award album, as well as others awards.
-  They will be able to select their favorite image, as well as see who else has earned that award.
-  This addon allows users with the permission to upload images that will serve as rewards.
-  These images can be assigned a name as well as how they were earned (e.g. Contest, Posts, or the name of a game)
-  Those with correct permissions can edit the image and information assigned to that image, as well as completely delete it.
-  And more!

## Installation:
This addon needs to make two template edits in order to add the post and signature awards to the post page.
